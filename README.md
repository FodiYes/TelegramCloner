**Cloner Userbot** is a standalone Python script for Telegram that allows you to instantly duplicate another user's public information: avatar, first name, last name, profile description (bio), and set a similar username.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Full Profile Duplication**: Copies all visible profile elements, including all photos.
*   **Intelligent Username Matching**: Automatically generates and attempts to set an available username similar to the target's.
*   **Backup System**: Automatically saves your original profile on the first run.
*   **Instant Recovery**: The `.revert` command allows you to instantly restore your original profile.
*   **Easy Setup**: An interactive installer will help you quickly set up and run the userbot.
